Hi, I’m Zhao Weibo (赵伟博), a first-year PhD student at the Asian Institute of Digital Finance (AIDF) at the National University of Singapore. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Professor Liang Zhenkai](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/liangzk/) and [Professor Zheng Huanhuan](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/our-people/faculty/zheng-huanhuan).
